watersheds sloping altadena pasadena way monrovia teams field observations already entered usgs computer programs generate maps showing debris flow hazard greatest mapswhich publicly available online later inform decisions officials issue alerts warning evacuation orders emergency planners try anticipate debris flows flash floods using hazard maps weather forecasts watch storms could drop certain amount precipitation onto severely burned slopes half inch rain 30 minutes quarter inch rain 15 minutes kostelnik says like put windshield wipers high debris flows arent guaranteed rainfall rates become much likely rainfall thresholds developed based lots field work observations types rain intensities caused triggered soil movement erosion turned debris flows says hydrologist jayme laber national weather service nws oxnard calif around 12 36 hours advance incoming storm nws may issue watch alert toresidents mobile devicesif forecasted rainfall could trigger debris flows flash flooding

kostelnick says theyre every drainage basin lost upon laber thatevacuations exhausting especially residents fires already displaced either youve lost home youre returning home evacuated fires youre told evacuate laber says one thing need understand emergency managers theyre keeping public peoples interest forefront theyre trying protect lives property complicating anxiety exhaustion fact debris
