1. To this sweet land, our mother, to which we owe our name, Guard her, Lord God, like always you have guarded, Remember her, which you have clothed with light. 2. Give, Great God, intellect to whom who governs, Give mercy to the proprietor, and strength to the workman, To let us serve upright, true and faithful, a united people, Maltese, and in peace.
