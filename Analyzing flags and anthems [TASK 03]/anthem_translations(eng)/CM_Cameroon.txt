1. O Cameroon cradle of our ancestors, Go, stand and jealous of your freedom. As the sun, your flag should also be proud, A symbol of ardent faith and unity, May all your children, North and South From East to West, are all love! May they serve you as their sole purpose To fulfill their duty forever. CHORUS: Dear Fatherland, dear land, You are our only true happiness. Our joy, our life To you, love and honor. 2. Thou art the grave where our fathers sleep, The garden that our ancestors have cultivated. We work to make you prosperous One day we finally arrived. Africaâ€™s children be faithful And still progressing in peace Hoping that your children Boundless love you forever. Chorus
